# City Art
iOS 11 Class project

# Overview
The app will work in two ways. One, if the art discovered is new to the app the user can take a picture of the art, mark 
it on the integrated map, and maybe write a description of the location/art. Two, using the app users will be able to look
at a map and see street art near them. They will also be able to click on the objects in the map and see a photo and the 
description of the art. 

My project will incorporate maps, gps location, and firebase to store all of the gps points, photos, and descriptions.
